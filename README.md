# Django AWS Backend

This is pet project of mine to automate skipping songs by boycotted artists in Spotify. This is the most robust iteration so far and I learned so much about Django, Django Rest Framework, Celery, and it was nice to continue my python development. 

## Features

- Django rest framework for building web applications
- Postgres database for data storage
- Celery for task scheduling and background processing
- AWS infrastructure for scale

## Usage

- Access the application at `https://skipify.ezdoes.xyz`
